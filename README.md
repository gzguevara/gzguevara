<tr>
  <td>Internship Project</td>
  <td>Computer Vision application for quality control.</td>
  <td> Task: Find items with a critically large size for the further process. Approach: Find edges of these items with edge-detection NNs. Construct convex hulls around the edges and calculate the size of the convex hulls. Conclusion: The application automatically recognizes critically large items. However, due to the spatial circumstances, the exact size might be measured incorrectly.</td>

  <td>Hackathon</td>
  <td><a href = "https://dsbattle.com/hackathons/gsb/">GSB Data Science Practice</a> Predtiction of company default.</td>
  <td>We implemented methods like Altman Z-score, Weights of Evidence and Binning, on which we built a Logistic regression. We made it on the first place by the results for the model quality. There is also a presentation to the code.</td>

  <td>Personal Project</td>
  <td>Web-app for recocnition of written numbers</td>
  <td>I wanted to build a webapp with the knowledge I had from my courses about neural networks. This webapp ist based on the MNIST numebrs data set and uses a ResNet18 NN. I had to build a rather complicated pipeline to transform the written numbers by the user from HTML-canvas to tensors which can be interpretaded by the fast.ai neural network. Feel free to contact me should you have any questions regarding the implementation. !!! It might take a few seconds for the webapp to load!!!</td>
