  <td> Task: Find items with a critically large size for the further process. Approach: Find edges of these items with edge-detection NNs. Construct convex hulls around the edges and calculate the size of the convex hulls. Conclusion: The application automatically recognizes critically large items. However, due to the spatial circumstances, the exact size might be measured incorrectly.</td>

    Web-app for recocnition of hand-written numbers
  </p> </td>
  <td>Every young data scientist starts from MNIST numbers :) In university courses you train some ResNet18 NN, look at some metric, and the course is done. I build a web-app, where the user can write numbers, which then get recognised and returned. I wrote a pipeline to transform the written numbers from an HTML-canvas to tensors, compatible with the NN. Loading the website might take a few seconds.</td>
