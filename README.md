  <td>We implemented methods like Altman Z-score, Weights of Evidence and Binning, on which we built a Logistic regression. We made it on the first place by the results for the model quality. There is also a presentation to the code.</td>

  <td>Personal Project</td>
  <td>Web-app for recocnition of written numbers</td>
  <td>I wanted to build a webapp with the knowledge I had from my courses about neural networks. This webapp ist based on the MNIST numebrs data set and uses a ResNet18 NN. I had to build a rather complicated pipeline to transform the written numbers by the user from HTML-canvas to tensors which can be interpretaded by the fast.ai neural network. Feel free to contact me should you have any questions regarding the implementation. !!! It might take a few seconds for the webapp to load!!!</td>
