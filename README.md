   Predict how DNA, RNA, and protein measurements co-vary in single cells. I used sparse-matrix SVD decomposition to handle the data size. I built custom vector-to-vector architectures with TF. I used ensemble methods, which were suited for the valuation metric. My team was awarded a ðŸ¥ˆ medal with +41 place jump on the private LB! We were invited to present our solution at the NeurIPS 2022 conferecne to present our solution.</td>

   Predict default ptobaility of customers - binary classification. My creativity in feature engineering got me 3 silver notbook medals. I used various methods based on WoE. I became a "Kaggle Notebooks Expert". My team provided an ensemble of a XGBoost, LGBM, CatBoost and RNN. We made it into the top 8% and were awarded a ðŸ¥‰ medal! </td>

    For our customer large size metal items posed risk in a metal process. I build an app for detection of large items. The app finds edges of items with edge-detection NNs. It constructs convex hulls around the edges and calculate the size of the convex hulls. The application automatically recognizes critically large items. Due to the spatial circumstances, the exact size might be measured incorrectly.

    Computer Vision Web-app with MNIST numbers

  <td>
    Every young data scientist starts from MNIST numbers :) In university courses you train some ResNet18 NN, look at some metric, and the course is done. I build a web-app, where the user can write numbers, which then get recognised and returned. I, however, wrote a pipeline from an HTML-canvas to tensors, compatible with the NN. Loading might take a few seconds.

   In my master thesis I explored the predictive capability of web-search traffic data for young companies subject to venture capital investments. The theoretical results can be found in the paper. The coding includes data collection, data analysis, testing hypothesis and data visualization - each part having an own notebook.
